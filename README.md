### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

```
npm install
```
This will install all npm managed dependencies and then run bower install to manage bower dependencies.

###The APIs

To present the vote history to the user we used the New York Times Congress API, The New York Times New API and the Sunlight API. All three require their own API keys, which are not included in this repo. In order to run the page locally you must add a `_config.js` file at the root level of your directory, with the following content:

```
var SESSION_SECRET = '<YOUR SECRET>';
var KEYS = {};

KEYS.NYTIMES_REPS = '<YOUR API KEY>';
KEYS.NYTIMES_NEWS = '<YOUR API KEY>';
KEYS.SUNLIGHT = '<YOUR API KEY>';


module.exports = {
  SESSION_SECRET: SESSION_SECRET,
  KEYS: KEYS
};
```

Where, `<YOUR SECRET>` is any unique string, which will be used to hash your session information, and `<YOUR API KEY>` are your own personal API keys for The Sunlight Project's service, and The New York Time's congressional and news services.
